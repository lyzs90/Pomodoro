# Pomodoro

Trying out different implementations of the pomodoro timer. Note that this is a scaled down timer to facilitate testing i.e. in seconds instead of minutes. Switch branches to view each of them.

## What's Available
- Vanilla JS MVC
- React.js (declarative views)

## Getting Started
- Run using Gulp, Browser-sync & Webpack: `gulp dev`. Changes to html/css will be reloaded live and hot module reloading is for the js.

## For Production
- Run Express, Gulp & Webpack with PROD settings: `npm build`
- Then push to Heroku `git push heroku master`
